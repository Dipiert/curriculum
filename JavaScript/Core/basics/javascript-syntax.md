Like most programming languages, JavaScript has a number of syntax rules that must be adhered to.

**Semicolon**

In JavaScript it is best practice to add a semicolon at the end of a statement:

```
var company="enki";
```

Itâ€™s not strictly necessary to do this as the parser will try to determine the end of a statement automatically. However, it will help you be sure that the code runs as expected.

**Comments**

Comments can be created in 2 ways in JavaScript.

As a single line comment:

`//I am a single line comment`

You can also add single line comments to the same line as other code:

```
var company="enki"; //define company
```

Or if you have more text you can use a block comment:
```
/*
I am a block comment
*/
```
