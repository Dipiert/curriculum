## Content

You can declare a string value in JavaScript using either single or double quotes - JavaScript will accept either:
```
var company = "Enki";
var company = 'Enki';
```

If you have longer text you can combine multiple strings by using the + operator:

```
var longerText = "abc" +
		"def" +
		"ghi";
```

You can also use the backslash character to "escape" the line feed, to write on multiple lines (make sure nothing is after the backslash except the carriage return).

```
var longerText = "abc\
def\
ghi";
```

There are also special characters that can be used by preceding the character with a backslash. Here are some common ones:
```
\â€™ single quote
\" double quote
\\ backslash
\n new line
\r character return
\t tab
```
